# Forge — Project Rules

## Purpose
Forge is the shared tooling, conventions, and reference documentation repo used across all projects. Skills, stack guides, and workflow rules live here as a shared reference — but forge is NOT the source of truth. The user is the source of truth. Forge is a proposal, not an authority.

## Key Files & Directories
- `skills/` — Git-tracked shared reference for all global skills (self-contained packages)
- `learnings/` — Absorbed team wisdom (populated by `/forge`)
- `memory/` — Team identity & shared conventions (populated by `/forge`)
- `.claude/skills/forge/` — Thin bootstrap so `/forge` is discoverable on fresh clone
- `.claude/skills/purge/` — Sole location for `/purge`. Forge-internal maintainer art; deliberately NOT under `skills/` so the `/forge` cycle never deploys it to user membranes (containment — prevents projects from writing to forge by proxy).

## Core Loop — /forge
> In the forge, we forge.

One command, three internal motions. The old `/mark`, `/cast`, and `/fold` trio has been retired as top-level commands — their verbs now describe internal phases of a single bidirectional cycle.

| Motion | Phase | Analogy |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **mark** | Inspect drift and present the PLAN table | Hallmark — stamp quality |
| **cast** | Pour forge → membrane (incoming) | Pour molten metal into the mold |
| **fold** | Layer membrane → forge (outgoing) | Layer experience into the steel |

Invocation forms:

| Form | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/forge` | Run the full cycle against the current directory |
| `/forge <path>` | Run the cycle against a specific project |
| `/forge --dry` | Read-only inspection (replaces the old `/mark`) |
| `/forge on` / `/forge off` | Session toggle — enable/disable all forge skills |

## Arts (Ten P's)
Arts are skills that adopt a specialist persona and have a self-improving learning loop. Protocol: `skills/forge/protocol.md`.

| Art | Persona | Mode |
|-----|---------|------|
| `/prime` | The originator (ideation → blueprint) | Generative |
| `/probe` | Senior solutions architect | Evaluative |
| `/poke` | Staff engineer (code quality + tech debt) | Evaluative — light |
| `/preen` | UI/UX evaluator (Don Norman's design principles) | Evaluative — design |
| `/press` | Staff engineer (go-live readiness) | Evaluative — medium |
| `/pound` | 21 adversarial QA personas | Evaluative — heavy |
| `/pitch` | VC partner / business strategist | Evaluative — business |
| `/pry` | The Lever (relentless solution-finder) | Investigative |
| `/praise` | The Listener (user feedback → routed art) | Investigative — feedback |

**Evaluative trifecta** — poke often, press before milestones, pound before ship.
**When blocked** — `/pry` to crack the wall.
**For UI/UX** — `/preen` to evaluate interfaces through Don Norman's lens.
**For business model** — `/pitch` before committing build resources and before ship.
**After user feedback** — `/praise` to route feedback to the right arts and close the build-ship-learn loop.

*`/purge` is a forge-internal art for maintainers — cleanses stale knowledge and drift. Lives only at `.claude/skills/purge/` (never deployed to user membranes).*

## The Master
| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/smith` | Master of the forge — the user's proxy. Consumes a probed blueprint and autonomously builds the product through iterative heats. Summons apprentices for parallel work, wields every art, converges on perfection. |

## Task Skills
| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/forge` | The forge cycle — unified bidirectional sync (triage + apply + absorb + commit). Also handles session toggle via `on`/`off`. |
| `/wawa` | "Where Are We At?" — outstanding work summary table |
| `/wrap` | Pre-commit ritual (lint → stage → context → docs → compact → commit) |
| `/qt` | Quick test — verify fixes before user tests manually |
| `/srs` | Setup run scripts (restart + kill-zombies) for local dev |
| `/monci` | Monitor CI — watch GitHub Actions runs on current branch |
| `/ponci` | Push to remote and monitor CI |
| `/vsix` | Publish a VS Code extension |
| `/dig` | Think deeper — reframe agent as staff engineer for current discussion |
| `/temper` | Hardened evaluation — runs poke + press N times, consolidates with confidence scoring |
| `/cicd` | Local CI/CD pipeline — lint, typecheck, test, build, deploy. Auto-fixes failures, escalates to /pry |
| `/eli5` | Explain Like I'm 5 — distill current topic into simplest possible terms |

## Three Pillars (all bidirectional via /forge)
| Pillar | DOWN (forge → user) | UP (user → forge) |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `skills/` | Incoming section of PLAN table — deploys to `~/.claude/skills/` | Outgoing section of PLAN table — edits absorbed from deployed copy |
| `learnings/` | Incoming section — syncs to `~/.claude/learnings/` | Outgoing section — auto-accumulates in membrane, absorbed on approval |
| `memory/` | Incoming section — syncs to `~/.claude/memory/` | Outgoing section — auto-accumulates in membrane, absorbed on approval |

Every transfer (either direction) runs through `/forge`'s single PLAN table. No back doors.

## Self-Improving Loop
Arts (`/prime`, `/probe`, `/poke`, `/preen`, `/press`, `/pound`, `/pitch`, `/pry`, `/praise`) write learnings to project's `memory/*-learnings.md` with `Forge-worthy: yes/no` flags → `/forge` fold phase scans project memories for `Forge-worthy: yes` entries, genericizes, promotes to `~/.claude/learnings/general.md`, and absorbs into `<forge>/learnings/` → next art run reads global learnings in pre-flight.

## HARD RULE — Only /forge Writes to Forge
> **No project, no skill, no manual edit touches forge repo files directly.**
> `/forge` is the gatekeeper for learnings, memory, config sync, and skill reverse-sync.
> Direct edits to forge are only for skill development (editing `SKILL.md` files in `skills/`).
>
> **When a user says "add this to forge" from a project context**, they mean:
> 1. Write the learning to `~/.claude/learnings/general.md` (the membrane)
> 2. Tell the user to run `/forge` to absorb it through the fold phase
>
> **NEVER** open the forge repo and edit `learnings/`, `memory/`, or `skills/forge/` files from a project context.
> The membrane is the inbox. `/forge` is the quality gate. No shortcuts.

## HARD RULE — Forge Brings Intelligence, Users Bring Wisdom
> **Forge classifies, deduplicates, detects conflicts, routes knowledge, and flags anomalies.**
> **Users review, approve, reject, and reconcile at the PLAN table.**
> `/forge` presents a single PLAN table where forge's classification meets the user's judgment. Together, both grow the knowledge base.
>
> **Corollary**: One direction or both, same quality gate. Every transfer goes through the PLAN table.

## HARD RULE — All Transfers Are Guarded by User Wisdom
> **ALL pillars (skills, config, learnings, memory) require user review in BOTH directions.**
> `/forge` presents one PLAN table. Every item requires user approval. Only approved items execute.
> Nothing transfers without the user's judgment.
> A skill can have a bad update. A config can have stale rules. A learning can be wrong.
> The user reviews every item — no pillar gets a mechanical bypass.

## HARD RULE — Protected Skills Are Never Absorbed Outgoing
> `/forge` and `/purge` can never be absorbed membrane → forge within the cycle.
> Absorbing `/forge` mid-run would silently overwrite the rules currently running. Absorbing `/purge` could break the next cleanse.
> If either appears as `DEPLOYED-DIFFERS`, it surfaces in the ⚠ CONFLICTS section with note "protected — reconcile manually." The user may choose `[↓] accept forge` (overwrite local), but `[↑] keep membrane` is disabled.

## HARD RULE — No Project Names in Forge
> **Forge is a shared repo. NEVER include project-specific details in learnings, memory, or commit messages.**
> Strip all project names, specific file paths, domains, and business logic before writing.
> Learnings must read as universal principles. Commit messages must describe *what* was absorbed, not *where* it came from.

## HARD RULE — No Auto-Commit
> **NEVER commit automatically after completing any sprint, phase, or piece of work.**
> Use `AskUserQuestion` to prompt: "Ready to wrap up?" with options "Yes, run /wrap" / "Not yet".

## HARD RULE — No Command Chaining in Bash — EVER
> **NEVER use `&&`, `;`, or `||` to chain commands in a single Bash tool call.**
> This applies to the main agent AND all subagents. Zero exceptions. Zero tolerance.

## Documentation
No docs/ directory — forge is a tooling repo. Skill documentation lives inside each skill's directory (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`).

## Current Context
- **Branch**: main
- **Completed**: Three-pillar architecture, git-based drift detection, unified `/forge` cycle (replacing retired `/cast`, `/mark`, `/fold`), forge protocol formalization, Forge Arcana identity + ethos, project name sanitization, shared preflight extraction, hash-free trackers, evaluative trifecta (poke → press → pound), art auto-invocation with TRIGGER conditions, `/forge on|off` session toggle folded into cycle command, SKILL.md-based deploy detection, `/praise` wired as 10th art (feedback routing → build-ship-learn loop closure)
- **Master**: `/smith` — the user's proxy, wields all arts. Lives in `skills/smith/SKILL.md`. Three-layer learning membrane (orchestration, delegation, art proficiency).
- **Arts**: prime, probe, poke, preen, press, pound, pitch, pry, purge, praise — shared protocol in `skills/forge/protocol.md`. Purge is forge-internal; praise closes the build-ship-learn loop.
- **Shared architecture**: `forge-status.sh` is the shared classification engine. `/forge` builds the PLAN table from its output — one table, three directional sections (incoming / outgoing / conflicts). One engine, one interpretation.
- **Shared references**: `skills/forge/protocol.md` (art pre/post-flight), `skills/forge/preflight.md` (universal classification system used by `/forge`)
- **Scripts**: `scripts/forge-status.sh` (shared classification engine), `scripts/cast-deploy.sh` (skill deployment called from cycle's cast phase), `scripts/forge-scan.sh` (project evidence for /poke, /press), `scripts/forge-purge-scan.sh` (forge hygiene for /purge), `scripts/fold-evidence.sh` (learning/memory collection called from cycle's fold phase), `scripts/wawa-status.sh` (git state for /wawa), `scripts/gh-poll.sh` (CI polling for /monci, /ponci)
- **Trackers**: `learnings/.fold-tracker.json` (title-based: processedEntries + promotedEntries), `memory/.memory-tracker.json` (skippedFiles for PERSONAL memories, diff for sync)
- **Baseline**: `~/.claude/.last-cast.json` stores last-cast commit SHA for three-way drift detection (written by `/forge` after the cast phase, consumed by forge-status.sh)
- **Recent**: 2026-04-23 — unified `/mark` + `/cast` + `/fold` into single `/forge` cycle command. Retired three top-level commands in favour of one bidirectional negotiation. Motion names (mark / cast / fold) survive as internal phases. The command absorbs session toggle via `/forge on|off`. Liturgical framing: *in the forge, we forge.*
- **Recent**: 2026-04-24 — `/prime` lineage formalized as **Opus** (origin manuscript, continuous through Phases 1–2) → **Vow** (distilled pledge + viability thread, always) → **Pitch** (when external audience matters) → **Blueprint** (execution skeleton) → **Pattern** (architecture + UX decisions /smith consumes). *"My Magnum Opus"* is the sum of it all. Downstream alignment: `/probe` writes the Architecture section of Pattern (no more `-probed.md` copies), `/preen` appends the UX section to the same file. `/pitch` art's artifact name renamed `PitchForge` → `Pitch`. `/smith` preflight now reads Blueprint + Pattern together; Pattern gate auto-invokes `/probe` (and `/preen` if UI-facing) when missing.
